The project is, of course, top secret and goes by the name ACaTAI (Advanced Consciousness and Thinking Artificial Intelligence) otherwise known as Cat's Eye. If you complete this project and get the AI to work, you will make history with one of the greatest AIs ever created. It runs on a quantum computer and has its memory stored on an Advanced Digital Nulceic Acid Storage or ADNAS. This type of storage has taken the power of DNA and used it for extremely efficent data storage, a near exabyte per gram of DNA. The AI learns through neural networking, that way you and your team doesn't have to code the entire AI by hand, but you still need to monitor its growth.\n \n");

The facility, which is called BotC (Body of the Cat) is a self-sustainable 5 level laboratory with a garage/storage on the top level, the level below that contains a natural river of water that powers a small turbine and contains an advanced hydroponic farm containing several genetically modified plant species. The third level contains the living quarters and the entertainment area for the entire team. Each person on the team has their own room with a modest bed, a powerful desktop computer, a closet, and a table. The entertainment area is mainly digital containing many different sources of entertainment. There is also a gym with machines, a swimming pool, and even a rock climbing area. The floor beneath that one is the dining hall and some other utility areas. The fifth floor contains the AI room, dubbed the Cat's Brain and houses the ADNAS and the quantum computer the ACaTAI runs on. It has many failsafes to prevent people with any bad intentions from getting to it. Spanning all levels of the BotC is the nuclear generator, whose controls are located on the fourth floor.\n \n");
